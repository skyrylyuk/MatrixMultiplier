# Multiply Matrices

## Description

Base algorithm and library with reference implementation was take by links:

https://www.baeldung.com/java-matrix-multiplication


How works with JUnit5 was take by links:
https://www.baeldung.com/junit-5

Approach used to generate test values based on article
https://www.baeldung.com/java-generate-random-long-float-integer-double

How implement custom matcher for hamcrest describe in article:
https://www.baeldung.com/hamcrest-custom-matchers

## Results

After implemented sequential and parallel version of algorithm, I make some measures, what must show some trends that should reflect the real situation with a small margin of error
